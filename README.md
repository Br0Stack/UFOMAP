# UFOMap

A responsive interactive leaflet map that displays UFO sighting across the world from 1940 - present day with dates and descriptions on mouseover. Click or tap the cluster circles to view sightings in that region. Best viewed in chrome. Leave some feedback!

* This project was one of the first I ever made, it was made for fun, and is not maintained any longer. Please excuse the awful code. Keeping this one public due to lots of interest from my mentees :) *
